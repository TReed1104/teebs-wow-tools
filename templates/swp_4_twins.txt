|cPurplePhase 1:|r
- Stay below the 2 tanks threatwise
    - If you overthreat, jump down
    - |cWarlockWarlocks|r and |cHunterHunters|r rememebr your shatters and FDs just before Hero
- {icon 45342} {spell 45342} Run to the drop spot
    - Use PVP Trinket or LAPS to break the stun and Healthstone
- Stay stacked to share the {icon 45329} {spell 45329} hits and drop your stacks
- All |cMageMages|r and |cShamanShamans|r need to be ready to dispel {icon 45230} {spell 45230} from Alythess ASAP
- If your stacks are high you can also clear them with Bubble/Block/Cloak


|cPurplePhase 2:|r
- When Sacrloash dies, jump down and stack behind Alythess tightly
- if targetted by {icon 45329} {spell 45329}, ensure you move directly under the boss so the whole raid gets hit
